What is Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging? Discuss its importance with an example.

Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is the process of marking up words in a text with their corresponding 
part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) based on both their definition and context.
Importance: POS tagging is crucial because:

It disambiguates words that can function as different parts of speech
It helps in understanding sentence structure and grammatical relationships
It's foundational for more complex NLP tasks like parsing, named entity recognition, and sentiment 
analysis.
It enables accurate information extraction from text

Example: In the sentence "They can fish," without context, "can" could be a modal verb or a noun 
(container), and "fish" could be a verb or a noun. POS tagging would correctly identify them based 
on context:

"They can fish" (They [pronoun] can [modal verb] fish [verb]) - meaning they are able to fish
"They can fish" (They [pronoun] can [verb] fish [noun]) - meaning they put fish in cans
