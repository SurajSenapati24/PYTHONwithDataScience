What is the significance of classes in Python programming, and how do they contribute to object
oriented programming?
Ans->Classes in Python are the blueprint for creating objects. They define the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) 
of objects. The significance of classes lies in how they help implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like 
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
By using classes:
-Code becomes more organized and reusable.
-We can create multiple objects from the same class without rewriting code.
-It allows real-world modeling, making complex programs easier to manage and understand.
-In short, classes are the foundation of OOP in Python, promoting clean, modular, and scalable code.
