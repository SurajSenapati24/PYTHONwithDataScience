1. How does the read method differ from the readlines method?
read method: Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.
readlines method: Reads the entire content of the file and returns it as a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file.


2. What is the purpose of JSON serialization?
JSON serialization converts Python objects into JSON strings, allowing them to be easily shared or stored. This is particularly useful 
for data exchange between a Python program and external systems or applications (like APIs or web services).


3. Why is the pickle module considered a security risk in some cases?
The pickle module can execute arbitrary code during deserialization because it reconstructs objects. If untrusted or malicious 
data is unpickled, it may execute harmful code, leading to security vulnerabilities.


4. What is the significance of file modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'b') in Python?
'r' (read): Opens the file for reading. An error occurs if the file doesn't exist.
'w' (write): Opens the file for writing, truncating the file if it exists or creating a new file.
'a' (append): Opens the file for appending content at the end of the file.
'b' (binary): Used in conjunction with 'r', 'w', or 'a' to work with binary files (e.g., images or executables).
